# Frontend Developer Assignment: Product Search and Filtering

## Objective

Build a product search and filtering application. This assignment will assess your UI/UX and logical skills.

## Time Limit

1.5 hours

## Requirements

### 1. User Interface (UI)

-   **Product Listing:** Display a list of products, each with at least a name, description, price, and an image.
-   **Search Bar:** A text input field to search products by name or description.
-   **Category Filters:** A set of checkboxes or radio buttons to filter products by category.
-   **Price Range Slider/Inputs:** A way to filter products by a minimum and maximum price.
-   **Sorting Options:** Dropdown to sort products by price (low to high, high to low) and name (A-Z, Z-A).
-   **Responsive Design:** The application should be usable on both desktop and mobile devices.

### 2. Functionality

-   **Data Source:** Use a free public API to fetch product data. We recommend using the [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/docs), which provides realistic product data with categories, images, and descriptions. Alternatively, you can use a local JSON file.
-   **Search Functionality:** Filter products dynamically as the user types in the search bar.
-   **Filtering:** Apply category and price range filters dynamically. Multiple filters should be combinable.
-   **Sorting:** Dynamically reorder the product list based on the selected sorting option.
-   **No Results State:** Display a clear message when no products match the current search/filter criteria.

## Evaluation Criteria

-   **UI/UX:** Is the interface intuitive, visually appealing, and easy to use?
-   **Logic:** Is the search, filtering, and sorting logic correct and efficient?
-   **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, maintainable, and follows best practices?
-   **Completion:** Are all the requirements met within the time limit?

## Submission

-   Please provide a link to your code repository
-   Include a `README.md` file with instructions on how to run the application.
